#### Description: 
# Generate plates map for extraction/PCR from a list of samples.

#### Usage:
# generate.plate.map(s, pos_ctrl_PCR = T, neg_ctrl_PCR = T, pos_ctrl_extract = T, neg_ctrl_extract = T, 
                  # random_samples = T)

#### Arguments:
# s                  a vector containing the samples names
# pos_ctrl_PCR       a logical value indicating whether to add a PCR positive control in each plate,
#                       or a numerical value indicating the number of controls to put in each plate
# neg_ctrl_PCR       a logical value indicating whether to add a PCR negative control in each plate
#                       or a numerical value indicating the number of controls to put in each plate
# pos_ctrl_extract   a logical value indicating whether to add an extraction positive control in each plate
#                       or a numerical value indicating the number of controls to put in each plate
# neg_ctrl_extract   a logical value indicating whether to add an extraction negative control in each plate
#                       or a numerical value indicating the number of controls to put in each plate
# random_samples     a logical value indicating whether to randomize sample positions in the plate 
#                       Note that PCR and extraction controls will always be located at the end of the plate
# set_plate_counter  a numerical value indicating were plate numbering should start
# set_seed           a single value, interpreted as an integer, to specify the seed for random number
#                       generation and allow reproducibility of the sampling for samples randomization

#### Details:
# Positive and negative extraction and/or PCR controls can be added in each plate. 
# If the total number of samples and controls is not sufficient to completely fill plates, the wells which will
# remain empty are filled with "empty" (euh bon c'est pas clair ce que je dis mais j'arrive pas Ã  le dire)

#### Value:
# Returns a list. The firt component of the list is a dataframe with one row per sample, indicating the plate number
# and the well in the plate for each sample. The second component of the list is a list of the plates maps (each 
# component of the list is one plate)
